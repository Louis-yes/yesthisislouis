The basic technique I have been using up to this point with my pop up card designs is lacking.

It is easier to intuitively know where a piece will sit both flat and elevated, but the end product has dull movement and no life. The technique itself doesn't need to be done away with, but other approaches must be included to make a more dynamic, exciting work.
