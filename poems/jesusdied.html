    <li>Jesus died in 2014, in Golgotha, 191A Dey St, Hamilton East, Waikato, Aotearoa New Zealand.</li>
    <li>Me, Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus came and took the body.</li>
    <li></li>
    <li>At the place where jesus was crucified there was a garden,</li>
    <li>and in the garden a new tomb, </li>
    <li>A tomb in which no one had ever been laid</li>
    <li></li>
    <li>It appeared close, but after 10 years we're still carrying his body</li>
    <li>from house to house, heart to heart, over international borders</li>
