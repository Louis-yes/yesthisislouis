        I'm working on a few cards at the moment, I really need to get a printer.
      </p>
      <p class="mb3">
        This first one here is an idea I had about approaching moments in life in which one feels multiple,
        sometimes conflicting but strong emotions. I want to do cards that aren't so comfortable, even just to experiment.
        I want this to be an artform, not because I see 'relatable' cards as below me but because I think they can be both,
        and perhaps doing one will help me with the other.
      </p>
      <p class="mb3 mt3">
        With this second one I'm trying to copy Andres Tena's illustration style, because my own is lacking.
        This wouldn't be a commercial one, just for practicing.
