# Festival of the photocopier 2022

I did this festival on around 1 ½  weeks of planning. The hand lettering of Resonance was harder to make sit well on the page, and I wish I’d planned that part better. Bike tricks was a real experience. I laboured over it for a fair while, but ultimately re did it all last minute - 

## what did I learn that I could have learned sooner?

- Black and white is cheaper and I believe breeds better constraints
- Big blocks of colour don’t read so well, prefer lines for cartoons
- Detailed images don’t work for 3d at this scale, unless the contrast is demonstrably greater than mine was.
- Wireframe maybe? Better rendering would help a lot
- Flat rendering at this scale also wasn’t great

I felt weird about “Que será el amor del sol”, with the optics of taking these photos off facebook, appropriating labour etc but ended up being pretty happy with it, and I think I sold out? Next time, too, I’ll count all the zines before and after so I know how many I sold.

## What did I enjoy?

- zines are a really nice manifestation of all that I like about cartoons, and would love a gag comic specific zinefest. This is what webcomics can be! All the fun of a niche instagram account, none of the awful advertising!
- I think making stuff is good for my soul

I sent a bunch of zines out to friends in NZ, got a fantastic review from [Arthur Emerson-McGlame](https://lilimor.tumblr.com/)

> Oh my GOD. Just to say your zines came today and I opened the envelope while waiting for my bus back home from south D, and my sort of boyfriend person kindly bought me my first pack of cigs in quite a while when we were drinking at the weekend so my lungs are already poorly this week, and it was windy at the bus stop too which makes them worse, and i laughed so hard at "bike tricks" that i legit had a couple of split seconds of "am i going to die?????? oh well worth it"
> 
> There was some other dude at the bus stop with me, the poor guy, i just could not stop laughing, i possibly looked a bit insane
> 
> I don't know how you do it
> 
> Like i can't articulate at all why it's so funny, it's just so fucking funny
> 
> And the teletubbies one
> 
> Big Dead Whale i love and it's on my whiteboard and might put teletubbies up too but i actually don't think i can display "bike tricks" because i'll absolutely injure myself over it if it catches me unawares
> 
> Just thinking about it now i'm laughing
> 
> It's so amazing
> 
> Actually i think i'll put it in my "coping kēte" for mental health crisis days because it's never going to not destroy me even if i'm like, catatonic or suicidal
> 
> It's just so good
> 
> "bike tricks"
> 
> Just the smile
> 
> And the angry man inside the window
> 
> You deserve to be doing this shit full time dude, like this is not funny to me just because you're my mate. I feel like that only makes it about 5% funnier
> 
> Anyway thank you so much. Absolute highlight
> 
> "bike tricks" i just can't handle it
> 
> I'm going to go do my music practice now because i need to stop thinking about it, it's too funny
