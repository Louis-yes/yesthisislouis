<p>I&#39;ve spent the week in Hobart working away trying to do a number of things</p>
<ul>
<li>Make crayon emoji mobile friendly</li>
<li>Improve return.horse</li>
<li>Update my artist site to be something I can show people</li>
<li>reflect on the year, plan for the year ahead</li>
</ul>

<p>Reflection:
The last year was good creatively, I began to practice structuring my projects, calling them finished or not finished. Making them measurable, letting them fail. It was not as smooth and precise as I thought it would be, but it wasn&#39;t too bad either.<br>Some projects ballooned out more than I expected, actually all of them did. I can learn from this!  </p>
<h2 id="resonance">Resonance</h2>
<p>This was a really nice project. The typography and website were just okay, but the writing was super fun and so was the drawing. I want to do more comics with felt tip pens, a really cool medium!<br>Maybe look at ways to make it less consumptive tho, refillable pens? 
Home made paint pens? Paint sticks? We will see. </p>
<p>The point is, colour is fun. </p>
<p>The way it was no pressure too was cool, and the requirement to draw things that looked right was not as much of a challenge as I expected.<br>Maybe we go for something more complex next? Hmm perhaps, perhaps not.</p>
<h2 id="crayon">Crayon</h2>
<p>This started out with <a href="../plot">plot</a> and was really fun, I learnt a lot building it.<br>It was interesting to see just how easy it is to make a complex feeling application, but also how quickly you run into bugs and complexity! </p>
<p>The architecture was the biggest learning experience. 
Other lessons include: </p>
<ul>
<li>UX and UI design is hard</li>
<li>copy and paste is inconsistent</li>
<li>emojis aren&#39;t that useful.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="returnhorse">Return.horse</h2>
<p>I spent literal months on this, carefully making a 3D cowboy, only to realise I was focusing on the wrong thing. I should remember that the first measure for these projects is me, only later should other people be considered. </p>
<p>The 3D was fun, but I would have been happy with the simple thing - and I am now. That being said, I think I can learn from the 3D experience, and I still really want to make more 3D comics. </p>
<p>The most important part still lies ahead though! This will have &gt; 300 comics before I&#39;m finished - how exciting.</p>
<h2 id="pledge">Pledge</h2>
<p>The pledge was, is, a difficult project. It&#39;s loads bigger than either of us expected. That being said, I&#39;ve learnt heaps and heaps working on it, and for that I am grateful. I didn&#39;t work on it in Hobart.</p>
<h2 id="home-page">Home page</h2>
<p>I didn&#39;t do very much work on this, but I did a little reflection and I&#39;m happy with the changes I have made / will make. </p>
<p>It is good to realise when something doesn&#39;t need to be worked on, when it can be left as it is and you can move on. </p>
<p>I&#39;m excited too for &quot;the yard&quot;. Seeing how easy and fun it was to use .md files on beaker to make a website, there&#39;s no reason I can&#39;t have the same fun here. Also, hopefully, I&#39;ll get a few more cartoon projects up. </p>
<p>Where and what for? Who can say, but the bee comic I made still makes me laugh now, and I want more of that.<br>Could lead to some more reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li>what do I want, creatively? </li>
<li>How do I balance it? </li>
<li>Tools with code take a stupid amount of time, but make me more employable?</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions, questions, questions.</p>
<h2 id="general-reflections-for-a-good-residency">General reflections for a good residency</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have a strictish routine - eating hours, morning tea etc.</li>
<li>Have at least one full day working</li>
<li>Have at least one full day off</li>
<li>Have at least 2 days split up</li>
<li>Do something unique to the location (eg Mona)</li>
<li>Go to the local museum</li>
<li>Take advantage of what the location offers
  - For example, being away from melbourne helped with a fresh headspace. I wish I&#39;d done more projects that made the most of that, rather than being bogged down with technical constraints in crayon emoji.</li>
<li>Only work on one project</li>
<li>Scope it before hand</li>
<li>Write a daily journal (I didn&#39;t, but wish I did)</li>
<li>Hang out with the locals</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-year-ahead">the year ahead</h2>
<p>I want to read and reflect more, then bring that into my practice. </p>
<p>I want to do more small projects, quantity over quality. Critical mass. yada yada yada. </p>
<p>Also, small projects can be polished easier and quicker. AND I learn so much more, and quicker with small projects! What good is a big project? Who does it help?? Small projects are the goal. </p>
<p>Maybe I name the year? Give it a theme.<br><del>2022: Make it smaller.</del><br>2022: Small</p>
