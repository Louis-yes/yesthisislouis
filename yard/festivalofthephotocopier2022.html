    <h1 id="festival-of-the-photocopier-2022">Festival of the photocopier 2022</h1>
<p>I did this festival on around 1 ½  weeks of planning. The hand lettering of Resonance was harder to make sit well on the page, and I wish I’d planned that part better. Bike tricks was a real experience. I laboured over it for a fair while, but ultimately re did it all last minute - </p>
<h2 id="what-did-i-learn-that-i-could-have-learned-sooner">what did I learn that I could have learned sooner?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Black and white is cheaper and I believe breeds better constraints</li>
<li>Big blocks of colour don’t read so well, prefer lines for cartoons</li>
<li>Detailed images don’t work for 3d at this scale, unless the contrast is demonstrably greater than mine was.</li>
<li>Wireframe maybe? Better rendering would help a lot</li>
<li>Flat rendering at this scale also wasn’t great</li>
</ul>
<p>I felt weird about “Que será el amor del sol”, with the optics of taking these photos off facebook, appropriating labour etc but ended up being pretty happy with it, and I think I sold out? Next time, too, I’ll count all the zines before and after so I know how many I sold.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-i-enjoy">What did I enjoy?</h2>
<ul>
<li>zines are a really nice manifestation of all that I like about cartoons, and would love a gag comic specific zinefest. This is what webcomics can be! All the fun of a niche instagram account, none of the awful advertising!</li>
<li>I think making stuff is good for my soul</li>
</ul>
<p>I sent a bunch of zines out to friends in NZ, got a fantastic review from <a href="https://lilimor.tumblr.com/">Arthur Emerson-McGlame</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh my GOD. Just to say your zines came today and I opened the envelope while waiting for my bus back home from south D, and my sort of boyfriend person kindly bought me my first pack of cigs in quite a while when we were drinking at the weekend so my lungs are already poorly this week, and it was windy at the bus stop too which makes them worse, and i laughed so hard at &quot;bike tricks&quot; that i legit had a couple of split seconds of &quot;am i going to die?????? oh well worth it&quot;</p>
<p>There was some other dude at the bus stop with me, the poor guy, i just could not stop laughing, i possibly looked a bit insane</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know how you do it</p>
<p>Like i can&#39;t articulate at all why it&#39;s so funny, it&#39;s just so fucking funny</p>
<p>And the teletubbies one</p>
<p>Big Dead Whale i love and it&#39;s on my whiteboard and might put teletubbies up too but i actually don&#39;t think i can display &quot;bike tricks&quot; because i&#39;ll absolutely injure myself over it if it catches me unawares</p>
<p>Just thinking about it now i&#39;m laughing</p>
<p>It&#39;s so amazing</p>
<p>Actually i think i&#39;ll put it in my &quot;coping kēte&quot; for mental health crisis days because it&#39;s never going to not destroy me even if i&#39;m like, catatonic or suicidal</p>
<p>It&#39;s just so good</p>
<p>&quot;bike tricks&quot;</p>
<p>Just the smile</p>
<p>And the angry man inside the window</p>
<p>You deserve to be doing this shit full time dude, like this is not funny to me just because you&#39;re my mate. I feel like that only makes it about 5% funnier</p>
<p>Anyway thank you so much. Absolute highlight</p>
<p>&quot;bike tricks&quot; i just can&#39;t handle it</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to go do my music practice now because i need to stop thinking about it, it&#39;s too funny</p>
