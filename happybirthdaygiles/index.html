				Happy Birthday Giles. <br>
				Congratulations on your many successes. <br>
				If we allow even one success a year (and surely 
				there are years of excess) we have a heaping 28, and many more to come.
			</p>
			<p>
				I miss you dearly, our regular phone calls and 
				jams this year have sustained me through a time of 
				grim loneliness and restriction. Our lives continue to 
				grow further apart, one would scarcely recognise the other, 
				but our hearts and desires seem to grow closer. I learn so much
				about myself, from talking to you. You inspire me.
				Making this episode was a joy, and I'm very excited to hear what you and 
				Campbell came up with. I hope you enjoy listening, or at very least enjoy the intro tune. 
			</p>
			<p>
				What else? I still remember the christmas you sent me photocopied poetry, and how good a gift it made.
				Curation is valuable, and costly, but it rewards both ways. So here's some stocking stuffers, from what I've been reading lately
			</p>

				<blockquote>
					When you’re losing a game you don’t even want to play, or forcing a fit into a form you don’t want to be in, the best thing to do is to stop playing and go find your shape. “If we accept ourselves and each other as form-makers,” wrote American philosopher Eugene Gendlin, “we will no longer need to force forms on ourselves or each other.” - <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/a-soft-manifesto/">A soft manifesto</a>

				<blockquote>
					Now one appreciate Saint Paul‘s incisive word choice...seen through glass darkly not a metaphor, but astute reference to optical distortion. We really do see astigmatically, in fundamental sense: our space and our time creations of our own psyche, and when these momentarily falter – like acute disturbances of middle ear.
