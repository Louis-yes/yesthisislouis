		<p>### Happy Birthday Brother. ###</p>
		<p class="text">
			I <i>can</i> believe it has been a year since we last made these, so much has happened between then and now. 
			I'm sorry we haven't seen each other more often, but you probably more than most understand
			why I'm so far away and what vague dreams I'm chasing. Making this podcast is special because it
			really captures a lot of the spirit of those dreams, as well as pulling them into the warm light of day. 
		</p>	
		<div class="tap b1"></div>
		<p>
			Of course this isn't about me, except that the nature of this gift is to bring forth what is within me, for you.
		</p>
		<div class="tap b2"></div>		
		<p>
			You have a had a huge year, and I'm extremely proud of all you've achieved. 
			Our calls have not been as frequent, because some of what you've achieved is alive and demanding. 
			This is true in part for many things we make, but true in entirety for Fenn and Alistair.
		</p>
		<div class="tap b3"></div>
		<p>
			This episode was a joy, once again, to make. What a great gift, a gift that gives to all. 
			I was going to wax lyrical about how much you inspire me, but I've read last year's birthday card and it looks like I've covered that.
			Not much has changed, but my admiration and gratitude have grown. 
			Thank you so much for your support, encouragement, and care. 
		</p>
		<p>
			
			And now, for my favourite part of the birthday message - Other people's writing!
		</p>
		<p>
			This one was picked, almost at random, from a book I'm reading at the moment. 
			Lorca's poems are all pretty grim, but refreshing, perhaps, for being less contemporary and more foreign.

		<p><em> After a Walk <br>
		by Federico Garc√≠a Lorca<br>
		translated by Greg Simon and Steven F. White</em></p>
		<ol class="poem">
			<li>Cut down by the sky.</li>
			<li>Between shapes moving toward the serpent</li>
			<li>and crystal-craving-shapes,</li>
			<li>I'll let my hair grow.</li>
		</ol>
		<ol class="poem" start="5">
			<li>With the amputated tree that doesn't sing</li>
			<li>and the child with the blank face of an egg.</li>
		</ol>
		<ol class="poem" start="7">
			<li>With the little animals whose skulls are cracked</li>
			<li>and the water, dressed in rags but with dry feet.</li>
		</ol>
		<ol class="poem" start="9">
			<li>With all the bone-tired, deaf-and-dumb things</li>
			<li>and a butterfly drowned in the inkwell</li>
		</ol>
		<ol class="poem" start="11">
			<li>Bumping into my own face, different each day.</li>
			<li>Cut down by the sky!</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>This next one is from a book I bought earlier this year, <em>Petal</em> by <em>Chelsea Hart</em></p>
		<p>
			Chelsea is a friend of a friend, and this is her debut book. This part talks about gardening, 
			which I know occupies a growing part of your life now that you're a landowner.
		</p>
		<ol class="poem">
			<li>Weeds are just </li>
			<li>misunderstood</li>
			<li>you told me</li>
			<li>defensively</li>
			<li><br></li>
			<li>Making room for dandelions.</li>
			<li><br></li>

			<li>Because they are seen as purposeless</li>
			<li>doesn't mean they have no purpose.</li>
			<li><br></li>
			<li>It was just</li>
			<li>'a plant in the wrong place'</li>
			<li><br></li>
			<li>of what?</li>
			<li><br></li>
			<li>your garden?</li>
			<li><br></li>
			<li>it was never yours anyway.</li>
		</ol>
		//
			<p><em>(Louis' note: I skipped a couple of stanzas here)</em></p>
		//
		<ol class="poem">
			<li>Something that grows</li>
			<li>outwards</li>
			<li>not upwards</li>
			<li><br></li>
			<li>is a story we dont talk about</li>
			<li>when we talk about growing.</li>
		</ol>
		//
		<ol class="poem">
			<li>You drew a rhizome for me once</li>
			<li>I was reading Deleuze.</li>
			<li><br></li>
			<li>You said:</li>
			<li><br></li>
			<li>'You don't need to read a book</li>
			<li>this big</li>
			<li>with all these words </li>
			<li>to know that things grow outwards and upwards.'</li>
