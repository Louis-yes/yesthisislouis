		Happy Birthday Giles!
		</p>
		<p>
		It's been over a year now since I was supposed to give this to you. 
		What is that invisible, unknowable obstacle that rises up 
		and sits between me and the task at hand?
		It is a game. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		In the past I was more concerned about saying something relevant 
		for the occasion. Reflecting on the years gone by, encouragement 
		in maturity, appreciation for the shared experiences. I would seek 
		out topical quotes and poems. This was fine, but it feels a little 
		like youthful folly. The occasion is right now, and what is relevant 
		is what I have to share. I've enjoyed putting this together. Moths 
		will eat our clothes, thieves will steal our riches, children will tear 
		up our books. Here's some artwork and poems I've enjoyed this last year:

				I saw this in the Museum of Fine Arts here in Buenos Aires. Took a photo, thought about it a lot. Came back to see it again this year. ~2000 years ago the cartoonish proportions I love were in turned loved.

				This is human sized, they had it displayed halfway up the stairs in the NGV National. In the corner, on the flat landing where the stairs turn on themselves to double back the horizontal distance from where they begin. I think it's funny that it has grass in it's basket. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg1lKivZqiw">"That's Meat Man's meat"</a>.

				Something about this strikes me as incredibly modern. 
				It's so saturated, and so exagerated. I think I sent this 
				to Dad for his birthday last year. I'm trying to keep it in
				the family. Crazy way to hold someone's head, with your fingers
				straddling one eyeball and your chin and jowel pressed over 
				the other one. Please never do this to me.

				The Gallery of New South Wales calls him Sydney,
				the National gallery of Victoria calls him Sid.
				He did other works where he inserted mythical greek
				figures into the australian landscape. His style
				is considered "art nouveau" inspired. I liked the portrait 
				orientation of this, the magical appearance of the trees, their
				thin branches like hairline cracks in a bright overcast sky. 
				I have produced very little from all my time reading about 
				plants and plant morphology, but I have received new eyes.

			Speaking of all my time reading about plants,
			here's a bit about Derek Jarman from one of the books I read: 
			<blockquote>
			<p>
			In 1987, Derek Jarman bought a former fisherman's cottage on 
			Dungeness Beach in Kent. It's a wild, bleak place: in one direction, 
			a nuclear power station looms like a portent of doom; in the other, 
			infinity is intimated in the slate-grey waves of the English Channel.

			The year before he bought Prospect Cottage, the artist, activist and 
			filmmaker was diagnosed with HIV.
			
			Writing in the catalogue accompanying this exhibition, Jarman's friend, 
			the photographer Howard Sooley, recalls: 'He cheated death hiding among
			the flowers and dancing with the bees.' Jarman painted the walls of his
			new home tar black and its window frames buttercup yellow. Refusing
			to be cowed by the inhospitable terrain, he cultivated plants that could
			withstand the shingle and the fierce, salty winds and bloom brightly:
			alexanders, foxgloves, periwinkle, poppies, purple iris, sea kale,
			viper's	bugloss and others. His garden was as much a metaphor 
			for memory and hope as it was earth and plants. 
			</p>

				<li>Here at the sea’s edge </li>
				<li>I have planted my dragon-toothed garden </li>

				<li>against those who protest their impropriety </li>
				<li>even to the end of the world. </li>
				<li>A fathomless lethargy has swallowed me, </li>
				<li>great waves of doubt broken me, </li>
				<li>all my thoughts washed away. </li>

				<li>I walk in this garden </li>
				<li>Holding the hands of dead friends. </li>
				<li>Old age came quickly for my frosted generation,  </li>
				<li>Cold, cold, cold, they died so silently. </li>
				<li>Did the forgotten generations scream  </li>

				Point of View (Punto de Vista)<br>
				From the series of interventions called "Nomad"<br>
				by Aaron Nachtailer (1986)<br>
				</p>
				<p>
				I walked past this other building on my way to the museum of
				fine arts. It's massive, styled like a roman pantheon. 
				It's the Law Faculty of the University of Buenos Aires.
				I saw something on the roof, though it was strange.
				Couldn't make out what it said. You can imagine my delight
				when I got to the roof of the Museum and found a pair of 
				binoculars, pointing across the road. "I am" (yo soy). 
				Eat your heart out Colin McCahon.
